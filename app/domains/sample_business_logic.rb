# CLEAN ARCHITECTURE
#
# There's nothing special about business/domain logic.  It's just POROs doing
# Surety things.  Break out your copy of POODR, and code up what's necessary.

# There's nothing special about this directory either. If it makes sense to put
# your logic someplace else, do so.

# If (and only if) you want to use Rails's autoload magic, then make the directory/
# file names match the module/class names in the standard fashion

class SampleBusinessLogic
  def useful_thing(arg1, arg2)
    # Doing something useful
  end
end
